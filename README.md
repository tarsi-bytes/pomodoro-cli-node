## 🧠 What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a popular time management method created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It boosts productivity by breaking work into focused time blocks — usually **25 minutes of deep work** followed by a **5-minute break**. Each work-break cycle is called a "Pomodoro."

After completing four Pomodoros, you take a longer break (15–30 minutes) to recharge and avoid burnout.

### 🍅 Why "Pomodoro"?

“Pomodoro” is the Italian word for **tomato**. Cirillo named the technique after the **tomato-shaped kitchen timer** he used as a university student to track his study sessions. The name stuck — and so did the method!
